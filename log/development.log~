Теперь у Сары родился сын Джон и время, когда он поведёт за собой выживших людей на борьбу с машинами, неумолимо приближается. Именно в этот момент из пост-апокалиптического будущего прибывает новый терминатор — практически неуязвимый и способный принимать любое обличие. Цель нового терминатора уже не Сара, а уничтожение молодого Джона Коннора.

Однако, шансы Джона на спасение существенно повышаются, когда на помощь приходит перепрограммированный сопротивлением терминатор предыдущего поколения. Оба киборга вступают в смертельный бой, от исхода которого зависит судьба человечества.
